Holla fellas. It has been a privilege to be called upon to give a talk on Firebase at a developer conference in University of Cape Coast on 28/10/2016. This is what I have been able to come up with.

<iframe src="https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1N2DJsJ7rhgq9n1yUekRvyEAOe-jGFqR3L_7Uca7FJOI/embed?start=false&loop=false&delayms=10000" frameborder="0" width="640" height="429" allowfullscreen="true" mozallowfullscreen="true" webkitallowfullscreen="true"></iframe>

A codelab will follow after the talk. I will make all the codelab resources available here as soon as we are done. #DevfestUCC 2016 #GDG #CodeRocks.

Ardios.
