Emerging Leaders in Technology and engineering [ELiTe](http://www.elite-education.org/) began in 2009 when co-founders, and Columbia University classmates, [__Chelsey Roebuck__](http://www.linkedin.com/pub/chelsey-roebuck/12/a10/b48) and [__Clayton Dahlman__](http://www.linkedin.com/pub/clayton-dahlman/14/106/302) took a summer trip to teach hands-on science in rural Ghana. For the program, then called ‘Piece it Together’, Chelsey and Clayton used a $10,000 grant to bring two other volunteers and whatever scientific equipment they could get their hands on to a school in [Nsawam](https://www.google.com.gh/maps/place/Nsawam/@5.8181146,-0.348022,13z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m2!3m1!1s0xfdf0c71326ec2b1:0xd5587c8564ab39be?hl=en), Ghana. ELiTE has since refined its mission and methods, and currently operates consistent educational programming to students in __Ghana__, __Mexico__ and __New York City__. ELiTE pushes the frontiers of traditional learning environments through its programs and innovative use of technology, and collaborates with partners locally and abroad to expand the reach of inspiring STEM education. ELiTE is entering a period of rapid growth, and they look forward to new opportunities in the months and years ahead.

That was just a small piece of history about the guys who made my week. To start with, ELiTe held their annual summer camp program for some high school students in [Cape Coast](https://www.google.com.gh/maps/place/Cape+Coast/@5.1322909,-1.2666142,13z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m2!3m1!1s0xfddfc29c7b3faad:0xeae5bdfb8639e093?hl=en) which started a few weeks ago. As usual, they were divided into two groups, for the usual programming class and engineering class.

This time around however, something interesting happened in the engineering class. Students were introduced to [_bio-chemical engineering_](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biochemical_engineering) by some final year students of Columbia University. In fact I should say even if the students did not understand whatever was said in that very bio-chem class (which I doubt), it was a chance for me to learn about something I knew nothing about.

I have been a helping hand in the programming class and I must say I was really impressed on how [Foster Adorkor](https://www.facebook.com/jet360.inc?ref=ts&fref=ts) a colleague in school helped the guys to put up their projects. Together with the instructor, __Jerome Jackson__, they did a very awesome work with the guys.

The students, after three weeks of study, were able to put up four exciting projects. For a fact, I remember only three of them which are a calculator app, and a chat app written in the python programming language and a home automation system developed by a group from the engineering class. On the day of the exhibition I could see the students were really excited about the chat application so I will briefly talk about it.

The chat app which they name __Elitefreechat__ is all about sending and receiving messages like any other chat application. In its simplicity, it only needs a user's name and a generic password and you are good to go. The contributors who are:

* Bright Dansu Jnr.
* Bismark Gyesi
* Ephirim Lawrence
* Amos Nortey
* Bamfo Owusu Samuel
* Benjamin Arthur
* Francis Nyarkoh
* Nicholas Damon
* Stephen Abbam

If you are excited already or you are curious to know, then try the app [here](https://www.elitefreechat.appspot.com) with the password __elite014__.

My week couldn't have been more better if these gallant youngsters including these other colleagues ([__Ibrahim Inusa__](https://www.facebook.com/iinusa), [__Stanley Hayford__](https://www.facebook.com/stanley.hayford1), [__Joshua Kumi__](https://www.facebook.com/joshua.kumi.71) and of course __Foster Adorkor__) didn't step up to continue the program for a period of one and a half weeks after Chelsey and his crew had to go home because of the Ebola treatment in West Africa. I am really proud to see us taking our own liberty into our hands and making things happen.
